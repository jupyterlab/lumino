Lumino is a set of JavaScript packages, written in TypeScript, that provide
a rich toolkit of widgets, layouts, events, and data structures. These enable
developers to construct extensible high-performance desktop-like web
applications, such as JupyterLab. Lumino was formerly known as PhosphorJS.

Lumino is Jupyter project and follows the Jupyter
[Community Guides and Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).
